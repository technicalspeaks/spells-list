			"title": "A Fire Protection Spell",
			"subtitle": "Protection through fire magick.",
			 "material": "1. Wood \n2. Matches \n3. Water",
			"Procedure": "In a clear spot at least 20 feet in diameter, gather together plenty of wood, matches, and a quantity of water. Taking up one of the sticks of wood, draw a rough circle about 11 feet in diameter. Determine the directions(use a compass. the sun, moon, stars) and lay a small fire at each point just inside the cricle: north, south, east, west.\n\n\nLay the fires, but do not light them. Next to each, place enough fuel to keep them burning at least half an hour.\n\n\nWalking up to the south first, light the fire, shouting these words as you do:\n\n\nNothing from the south can harm me!\n\n Then to the north and repeat, and finally the east.\n\n Snatch up a burning stick from the southern fire and thrust it at the sky above you(be careful of burning sparks and ashes) and say: \n\n Nothing from above can harm me!\n\n Next throw the flaming wood on the earth and say:\n\n Nothing from below can harm me!\n\n Replace the stick in the southern fire and sit in the center of the circle, watching the fires burn. As necessary, add more fuel. Know that the fires are literally burning away all that comes to harm you, on every level.\n\n Firmly implant in your mind the sight of the fires burning around you, the feel of their heat(which can become intense), their light, and their protective qualities.\n\n When the fires begin to die and you feel the power ebbing, bury the fires with earth or sand, douse with water, and obliterate the circle you've drawn on the ground.\n\n Leave the area but retain the fiery circle of protection within your memory, so that it can be recalled at any time you feel the need for protection: physical, spiritual, or mental.\n\n  If you are prevented from performing this ritual outdoors, substitue four large red candles for the fires. Proceed with the spell above, lighting the candles rather than fires, until all four are lit and you have said the words.\n\n\n Then, instead of taking a burning stick, pick up the southern candle and hold it carefully over your head. Say the words, then place the candle on the ground, saying those words. When the ritual is done, pinch out the candles, beginning with the west (never blow them out)."
